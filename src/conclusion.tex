\chapter{Conclusion}
This study demonstrates that combining TOF-MRA-guided carotid segmentation with Bayesian partial volume correction improves non-invasive input function estimation for PET/MRI in comatose patients.
While the method reduces reliance on invasive sampling, residual variability underscores challenges in spill-over correction and registration accuracy between PET and MR-derived vascular masks.
Future validation must address limitations in the current PCA framework by establishing standardized reference cohorts and expanding to multi-center studies with diverse patient populations.
By refining anatomical alignment protocols and ensuring consistent prior knowledge integration, this approach can enhance reliability for clinical translation, ultimately supporting safer, patient-friendly quantitative PET imaging.
